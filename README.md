# Scanning-Tool-Quality

* C# based application for the quality cage that captures information with a Cognex scanner, 
	this is used when a complete assembly was restored and need to be back at the line, puts the scanned serial into a textbox, makes a SQL consult to
  obtain the dates and the whole part list of the product scanned, when you have all the information and press okay, it deletes the info form the main database, and
	puts it into another one to have a record of the recovered pieces
